                <h2>Background of the study</h2>
                <p>
                    Stock market provides the bridge through which the savings of surplus units may be transformed into medium and long-term investments in the deficits units. It is reputed to perform critical functions, which promote economic growth and prospects of the economy (Adenuga, 2010). Stock prices often serve as the basis for the assessment of whether a firm is breaking even or not. These prices are
                    relevant metrics of returns to stakeholders, therefore the value attached to them and their direction of movement matters so much to both existing and prospective investors in the capital market.

                <p>
                    According to Wilson and Aziegbemin (2022), the stock market plays an important role in financial intermediation in both developed and developing nations by shifting idle capital from surplus to deficit units in the economy. As the economy expands, more resources are needed to meet the demands of rapid expansion; the stock market serves as a useful tool for mobilizing and distributing assets among conflicting goals that are critical to the economy's growth and efficiency (Alile, 1984).

                <h2>Key Determinants</h2>
                <p>Based on theoretical and empirical literature, the study considers the following variables as major determinants of stock market performance in Nigeria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> Influences the cost of capital and investors’ portfolio decisions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Exchange Rate:</strong> Impacts foreign investment flows and corporate profitability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Money Supply:</strong> Reflects liquidity conditions within the economy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> Represents overall economic activity and growth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>The study employs a quantitative time-series research design using secondary data obtained from relevant national and international sources.
                    Econometric techniques such as unit root tests and cointegration analysis are applied to determine the existence of long-run relationships.
                    Appropriate long-run estimation methods are then used to assess the magnitude and direction of the effects of the selected variables on stock market performance.</p>
